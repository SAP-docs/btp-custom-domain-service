# Extension Landscapes

Extension landscapes \(XLS\) are Cloud Foundry \(CF\) landscapes in the same region as a main landscape, which can be used for your own CF environment \(PaaS\), for subscribed applications \(SaaS\), or for both. A main landscape can have none, one, or multiple extension landscapes.



A single BTP subaccount can contain one CF environment, either in the main landscape or in one of its extension landscapes.

A single BTP subaccount can contain one or multiple subscriptions to SaaS applications, in the main as well as in one or multiple of its extension landscapes.

Like a main landscape, all extension landscapes have their own load balancers, with unique DNS domains and IPs. They are distinguished by counter values as part of the data center identifier; for instance:

[Required Custom Domain Configurations](required-custom-domain-configurations-5d5c3cf.md "At least two separate custom domain configurations are required to fulfill the desired setup; one in the eu10 main landscape and one in the eu10-003 XLS. It is not possible to use the same server certificate for both. It is also not possible to import server certificate private keys from outside; they are always generated by Custom Domain Service inside a secure storage, which does not allow import or export operations to the front end.")
