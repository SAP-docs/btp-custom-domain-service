To test your custom domain and make sure it's reachable and secured by a certificate, open your application under its custom domain in a browser.

## Context

Whether or not your application can be securely reached on its custom domain, depends on different factors such as the activation time of the custom domain. Therefore, it's important that you check your custom domain after setting it up. Remember that although the setup process of your custom domain takes only a few minutes, the DNS configuration can take several hours, depending on your provider.
