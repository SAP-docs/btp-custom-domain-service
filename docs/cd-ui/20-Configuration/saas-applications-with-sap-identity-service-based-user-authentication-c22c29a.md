# SaaS Applications with SAP Identity Service-Based User Authentication

For SaaS applications with SAP Identity Service-based user authentication, a custom SaaS route is added to *IAS tenant* \> *Bundled Application* \> *your SaaS application* \> *Single Sign-On* \> *OpenID Connect Configuration* \> *Redirect URIs and Post Logout Redirect URIs*.



When the custom SaaS route is deleted, it's removed from the redirect and post logout redirect URIs.
