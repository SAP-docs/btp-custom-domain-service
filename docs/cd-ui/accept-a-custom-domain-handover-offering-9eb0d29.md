## Procedure

1.  Log on to the *Target Subaccount* and open Custom Domain Manager.

3.  Switch to *Domain Handover* tab.

    Any offered custom domains are listed under *Domain Handover Offers Received*.

4.  Choose *Accept* to open the corresponding wizard and accept the offer.

    A domain reservation is added. Optionally, a custom domain is created in your Cloud Foundry environment.
