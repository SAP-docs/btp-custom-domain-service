# Revoke a Custom Domain Handover Offering

In the *Source Subaccount*, you can **revoke** an offered custom domain as long as it has not been **accepted** by the *Target Subaccount*.



## Procedure

1.  Log on to the *Source Subaccount* and open Custom Domain Manager.

2.  Choose the *Domains* tile.

3.  Switch to *Domain Handover* tab.

4.  Under *Domain Handover Offers Sent*, choose *Revoke* to remove the custom domain listed as offered.

    The revoked custom domain now disappears from *Domain Handover Offers Sent*.

    > ### Note:  
    > Once the *Target Subaccount* has accepted the offer, it is not possible to **revoke** it.
