# Required Authorizations

To use the Custom Domain Manager to manage private domains within your Cloud Foundry organization, you need to have the necessary authorizations.



Ensure that you have the **CustomDomainAdmin** or **CustomDomainViewer** roles to manage or view your custom domains, respectively.

> ### Tip:  
> Once you use the Custom Domain Manager and the **CustomDomainAdmin** role, your subaccount user does not need to be a Cloud Foundry organization member or have the **SpaceManager** role anymore.
