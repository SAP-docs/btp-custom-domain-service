### Check Platform Status

Create a subscription by specifying Cloud Product, Cloud Service, and Notification Type. For more information, see [Cloud System Notification Subscriptions User Guide](https://support.sap.com/content/dam/support/en_us/library/ssp/my-support/systems-installations/cac/csns_user_guide.pdf).

For more information about selected platform incidents, see [Root Cause Analysis](https://help.sap.com/viewer/product/SCP_RCA/Latest/en-US).



### Check Guided Answers

In the SAP Support Portal, check the [Guided Answers](https://ga.support.sap.com/dtp/viewer/index.html#/tree/2437/actions/32393) for the Custom Domain Service.

We also recommend that you regularly check the SAP Notes and Knowledge Base for component `BC-CP-CF-SEC-DOM` in the [SAP Support Portal](https://support.sap.com/en/index.html). These contain information about program corrections and provide additional information.

If you encounter an error because your custom domain is missing from the `redirect-uris` parameter of the application's security descriptor file, refer to the following solution in the guided answers format.
