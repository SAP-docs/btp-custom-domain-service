# Map Your Own Application to a Custom Domain

To make your application reachable from your custom domain, use the Cloud Foundry CLI to map a route to your application.



<a name="loiod898407897f6466385959e364ce5018e__prereq_ztr_14p_jgb"/>

## Prerequisites

Create and deploy an app within the Cloud Foundry environment. For more Information on deploying an app, see the related links.



## Procedure

1.  Map your application to your custom domain:

    ```
    cf map-route <Application Name> <Custom Domain> --hostname <Application Hostname>
    ```

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ```
    > cf map-route app applications.example.com --hostname myapp
    > ```

    > ### Note:  
    > -   If youâ€™ve already deployed your application, you probably specified a host name for it, either in the manifest file or while pushing the app. By default, the name of the app serves as its hostname; however, you can change it using the command `map-route`.
    > 
    > -   For more information about mapping and routes in the Cloud Foundry environment, visit: [https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html) 

    This command results in a route that looks like this: **https://myapp.applications.example.com**.

2.  Verify that the routing of your application is correct:

    ```
    cf routes
    ```
