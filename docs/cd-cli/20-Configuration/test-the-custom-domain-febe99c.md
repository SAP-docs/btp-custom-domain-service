# Test the Custom Domain

To test your custom domain and make sure it's reachable and secured by a certificate, open your application under its custom domain in a browser.



## Context

If your application can be securely reached on its custom domain depends on different factors such as the activation time of the custom domain. Therefore, it's important that you check your custom domain after setting it up. Remember that certain steps during the setup process of your custom domain can take up to 24 hours and the DNS configuration can take several hours, depending on your provider.



## Procedure

1.  Open your browser and enter the custom domain address of your application. The address has the following scheme: **https://<Application Hostname\>.<Custom Domain\>**, for example **https://myapp.applications.example.com**

    > ### Note:  
    > You can look up the hostname of your application and your custom domain by typing: `cf routes`.
