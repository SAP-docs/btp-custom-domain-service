# Create the Service Instance with the Cloud Foundry CLI

To use the Custom Domain service for your applications, use the Cloud Foundry CLI to create a service instance for your Cloud Foundry organization.

## Prerequisites

-   Download and install the Cloud Foundry command-line interface \(CLI\); see [Download and Install the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Validation/en-US/4ef907afb1254e8286882a2bdef0edf4.html "Download and set up the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) to start working with the Cloud Foundry environment.") :arrow_upper_right:.

-   Configure the entitlement for the Custom Domain service and assign it to the subaccount that wants to use the service; see [Configure Entitlements and Quotas for Subaccounts](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Validation/en-US/5ba357b4fa1e4de4b9fcc4ae771609da.html "Assign entitlements to subaccounts by adding service plans and distribute the quotas available in your global account to your subaccounts using the SAP BTP cockpit.") :arrow_upper_right:.

## Context

If you want to use a service from SAP BTP, you have to first create a service instance for that service.

## Procedure

1.  Log in to your Cloud Foundry account:

    ```
    cf login
    ```

2.  Enter your credentials.

3.  Create the service instance:

    ```
    cf create-service INFRA custom_domains <Service Instance Name>
    ```

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ```
    > cf create-service INFRA custom_domains custom-domain-service
    > ```

    > ### Note:  
    > `INFRA` is a fixed value for the Custom Domain service, `custom_domains` is a fixed value for the service plan, and `custom-domain-service` is an individual name that you can choose for the service instance. Assigning it a descriptive name helps you to distinguish it from your other service instances.

## Results

Youâ€™ve now created a service instance for custom domains.

> ### Note:  
> You have to create the service instance only once for every organization. You don't have to bind this service to an application.
